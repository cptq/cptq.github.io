      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m Derek Lim, a second-year EECS PhD (started in 2021) student at MIT CSAIL advised by Stefanie Jegelka. This summer I&amp;rsquo;m a research intern at Meta AI. I&amp;rsquo;m currently working on equivariant neural networks and graph neural networks, with a mix of theory and practice.
My research is supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship (NSF GRFP). I did my undergrad in Math and Computer Science at Cornell University.</description>

      <title>Flags Ranked by Matrix Rank</title>

      <description>One day I was watching a lecture, and the lecturer noted that the flags of some nations, when viewed as matrices, have quite low rank, in the sense of the standard concept from linear algebra. I found this remark pretty amusing, so I set out to compute the ranks of some flags. The flag of Bolivia has rank one, since all of its columns are the same and hence any two columns are linearly dependent.</description>

Cornell Undergrad Notes This is a compilation of notes in \(\LaTeX\) for some of the courses that I have taken at Cornell. These notes are taken in class so they tend not to include drawings and may be messy at points; the blame should fall on me—not the instructors—for any issues in the notes.</description>
