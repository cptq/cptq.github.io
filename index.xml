Cornell Undergrad Notes This is a compilation of notes in \(\LaTeX\) for some of the courses that I have taken at Cornell. These notes are taken in class so they tend not to include drawings and may be messy at points; the blame should fall on me—not the instructors—for any issues in the notes.</description>
