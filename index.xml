      <title>Flags Ranked by Matrix Rank</title>

      <description>One day I was watching a lecture by Alex Townsend, when he noted that the flags of some nations, when viewed as matrices, have quite low rank. I found this remark pretty amusing, and as it recently passed my mind again, I set out to compute the ranks of some flags. The flag of Bolivia has rank one, since all of its columns are the same and hence any two columns are linearly dependent.</description>

      <title>Endless Eigenart in 3 lines of code</title>

      <description>Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is everything else we do. — Donald Knuth
 If we import numpy and matplotlib,
import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt then we can generate really nice art in just 3 lines of code.
As = np.random.randn(6,6,3) vals = [val for s in np.linspace(0,1,500) for t in np.linspace(0,1-s,500) for val in np.linalg.eigvals(s*As[:,:,0] + t*As[:,:,1] + (1-s-t)*As[:,:,2])] plt.</description>

      <description>Cornell Undergrad Notes This is a compilation of notes in \(\LaTeX\) for some of the courses that I have taken at Cornell. These notes are taken in class so they tend not to include drawings and may be messy at points; the blame should fall on me—not the instructors—for any issues in the notes.
